# 2bored2wait-quarry

Nothing here yet still working on the proof of concept.

## setup

Currently depends on an authed prismlauncher session and linux.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./2bored2wait-quarry.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 8888 -b connect.2b2t.org -q 25565
```

Then connect to 127.0.0.1:8888 with your minecraft client.
And ideally you end up on the oldest anarchy server in minecraft.
